# Python variables

Programming languages make use of variables. Variables are also often seen in regular math. A simple example is the formula `8 * x = y`. `x` and `y` can be a wide variety of numbers. Python variables are not limited to numbers, they can hold other data types as well. 

Python variables can simply be seen as names referring to pieces of data. This data can then change during the programs lifecycle.

Take a look at the [example script](variables.py) and try running the script with `python3 variables.py` from a terminal window. You should also have option to run the script directly
from your IDE.
