# Flow control

The cool thing about programming is that you can make your
program do certain things in certain conditions.

I won't bore you too much with the theory. I am convinced
that you will learn faster when you play around with the
language. It's also a great deal of fun!

I have prepared the [flow_control](flow_control.py) script for you.
Just run it from the command line with `python3 flow_control.py`
or press that run button in your IDE.

Do read the comments and try to play around.

## Comparing things

If statements and while loops require you to compare
things to one another. You can do this with comparison
operators. Here is an overview of the comparison operators
in Python.

| Operator | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| < | Lower than |
| <= | Lower than or equal to |
| > | Greater than |
| >= | Greater than or equal to |
| == | Equal than |
| != | not equal than |

## Multiple conditions

You can define multiple conditions in if statements and while
loops by using the 'and' and 'or' operators.
The [multiple_conditions](multiple_conditions.py) script demonstrates
their use.
