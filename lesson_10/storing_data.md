# Storing data

The will come a time when you want to store some data, so you can
load it back into your program at a later date. An example of this
is a shopping list.

The [shopping_list](shopping_list.py) program will allow you to
create a shopping list. You can run the program with the following
command: `python3 shopping_list.py`.

Add some items to the list, save the list and quit the program.
Then run the program again. You will notice that your previously
saved shopping list is loaded back into the program.

Your shopping list is saved to the shopping_list.json file which
is created in the same directory where the program is located.

The shopping list is saved in the JSON format. You can learn
more about it [here](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).
